            <p>Alright, you’ve probably seen
                the mind-blowing results of Stable Diffusion — images popping up from just a few words. But what if I
                told you that <i>you</i> can code it from scratch? Yeah, that’s right. No magic here, just good old
                coding and math. It's a journey that’s going to challenge you, excite you, and maybe even make you
                question your life choices when debugging at 3 AM. But trust me, you’ve got this!<br><br><b>The Magic
                    Formula</b>: Coding Stable Diffusion isn’t as impossible as it sounds. You’ve got the power to do
                it, as long as you have the right tools and the right mindset. And guess what? You don’t need to be a
                math wizard to get started. Just a little bit of basic math and Python, and you’re all set. Don't worry,
                I’ll walk you through it.<br><br>Prerequisites: What You Need to Know (Don’t Panic, It’s Not That
                Bad)<br></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Mathematics:<br>- <b>Basic Math</b>: Addition, subtraction, and all that jazz. You’ve got this.<br>-
                    <b>Vectors</b>: A little knowledge of vectors won’t hurt, and you'll find it actually pretty cool
                    when it clicks.<br>- <b>Matrix Addition and Multiplication</b>: You've probably studied it in your
                    school years, but even if you haven't, it's still pretty easy. Lot's of good tutorials on YouTube.
                </li>
                <li>Coding:<br>- <b>Basic Python</b>: If you can write a for loop, you’re halfway there. We’ll go over
                    what you need, but knowing how to control the flow of your code will be key.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p><span style="font-size: 22px;"><b>How We’ll Work:</b></span><br><br>This journey is going to be
                incredibly detailed—we’re talking about many, many steps along the way. But don't worry, I’ll guide you
                through each one.<br><br>For most things, I’ll make sure you understand the math and the intuition
                behind it. If not the math, you’ll at least know why we’re doing it. Trust me, it’ll all come together.
                You won’t be left wondering why we’re studying something or how it fits into the bigger picture. And by
                the end of this, you’ll have the full picture.<br><br>We’ll break things down into blocks. First, we’ll
                go over the basic concepts and everything you need. After that, we’ll dive into the math, then we’ll
                start writing code. Each step will build on the last.<br><br>Once we’ve learned all the individual
                components, we’ll start connecting everything together, step by step. It might not always make sense
                right away, but I promise, it will be worth it. You don’t have to know everything upfront—just trust the
                process.<br><br>I won’t make you study anything extra, and everything I have you learn will be useful in
                multiple places. It's kind of like learning a new language—sometimes, you just have to accept the ground
                truths, even if you don’t fully get it at first. But don’t worry, you’ll get there.<br><br><br><span
                    style="font-size: 22px;"><b>What I Expect From You:</b></span><br><br>I expect you to stay focused
                and give it your all. When we’re coding, code. And when we’re learning, grab a pen and paper and write
                things down. <a

                    target="_blank">According to a study, writing things by hand activates a lot more brain networks
                    than typing</a>.<br><br>So, get ready to work and let’s make this happen. You’ve got this, and I’m
                here to help you every step of the way!<br></p>
